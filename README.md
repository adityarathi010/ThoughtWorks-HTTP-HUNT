# ThoughtWorks-HTTP-HUNT
ThoughtWorks HttpHunt REST API Challenge

In this game, you will have to solve series of programming challenges till you hit the finish line(mostly 4 stages). But there's a bit of a twist to it.

The whole game is driven by HTTP REST APIs. You can read about REST at 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer 

Few important guidelines:
  1.	For every API call, pass your UserID as an HTTP header with key "userId". Your userId is <#YOUR_USER_ID>. If you don't do this step,       you will receive an "Invalid user!‚Äù error.
  2.	For every POST API call, you need to pass "content-type" as "application/json" as well.
  3.	For every API call, use the host as https://http-hunt.thoughtworks-labs.net

So how should you start playing?
  Hit an endpoint GET https://http-hunt.thoughtworks-labs.net/challenge which would give you further instructions.
